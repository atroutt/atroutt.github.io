{"name":"Audrey Troutt","tagline":"Energetic full-stack developer. Creative type. Organizer of things.","body":"## About\r\n\r\nFull-stack developer with over seven years' experience, I have supervised developers and managed projects. I have moved major projects to iterative development cycles focused on high priority features with code reviews and improved unit testing and code quality. This has improved customer satisfaction due to better communication and reduced defects and made for happier developers too.\r\n\r\nI have also served on internal task forces and working groups to improve internal communication, project practices and organizational procedures for the entire organization. With or without a special title I seek out opportunities to foster growth and positive change in myself, my projects, my teams and my entire organization every day.\r\n\r\nThis passion extends outside of my job to my work in the community as an active member of the local tech scene. I organize code kata nights, teach programming to young girls and volunteer my time as a programmer, project manager and agilist at hackathons and other informal volunteering engagements.\r\n\r\nI have exclusively worked in smaller organizations, bootstrapping, wearing 10 different hats and doing the absolute best I can with what I have and I have been very successful in that space.\r\n\r\n## Speaking\r\n\r\nI frequently present at user groups and conferences on various topics. Most recently on automated UI testing for mobile and building effective android apps.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/audreytroutt)\r\n* [@auditty on Twitter](https://twitter.com/auditty)\r\n* [Blog](http://audittyindeed.blogspot.com/)","google":"UA-19828277-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
