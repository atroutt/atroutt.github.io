Audrey Troutt is the Chief Technology Officer at Tomo, where she founded the engineering organization and led the team in building Tomo’s platform from the ground up. Since launching in 2021, she has helped shape a company that is reinventing the home buying experience, creating [the most delightful, no-drama, low-cost mortgage possible](https://tomo.com/).

Audrey didn’t start in tech. She studied music and physics before falling in love with software development. What began with small scripts and freelance projects turned into a career leading high-performing engineering teams at fast-moving startups and Fortune 50 companies.

Prior to Tomo, Audrey was a Director of Mobile Engineering at Comcast, where she led teams building iOS and Android apps for the Connected Living group — empowering millions of users to manage their wifi networks, smart home devices, and home security systems. Earlier in her career, she held leadership roles at startups like SnipSnap, Tune, and Artisan Mobile, and was often brought in to scale systems and teams alike.

Audrey is a polyglot programmer and full-stack engineer at heart. She cares deeply about clean code, thoughtful automation, and creating environments where engineers can do their best work. She is also a committed community builder: she’s taught with TechGirlz and Girl Develop It Philly, organized conferences like Philly ETE and [Women in Tech Summit](https://womenintechsummit.net/), and regularly speaks at events on software craftsmanship, technical growth, and inclusive leadership.

She holds a Master of Computer and Information Technology degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a BA in Music and Physics from New College of Florida. She lives in Philadelphia with her family and enjoys learning new languages and exploring the ever-changing landscape of Generative AI.
