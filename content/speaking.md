I am available to speak at tech user groups and conferences. Some of my past topics include technical documenation, effective user analytics integration patterns, career growth from tech lead up to engineering director, Android metaprogramming, TDD, automated testing for mobile, building effective remote development teams, and teaching kids to code. I'm eager to talk more about mobile app development, deep linking, mobile marketing automation, A/B testing implementation, automated testing, engineering management, and SDK development.

For speaking invitations, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audreytroutt/).
