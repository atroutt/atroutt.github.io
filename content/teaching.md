## Android for Beginners

This is a practical introduction to app development on Android. At the end of this class students know not only how to start a new app project, but also how some of the most common features in Android apps are implemented. Students become acquainted with standard Android, Google, and open source libraries for building Android apps. Course sections include: Running your first app, Anatomy of an app, APIs and authentication, Cameras and photos, and Testing and Refactoring. See the [complete course deck](http://audreytroutt.com/android-beginners/#/).

It is important to build things from scratch, understand existing code, and take things apart. Therefore the coding exercises area a combination of read and edit, build from pieces, and starting from scratch.

## Intro to Kanban

When my teams switched from Scrum to Kanban I prepared this overview of the new process, including: How Kanban differs from Scrum, the core principles behind Kanban (visualize work, limit WIP, focus on the flow of work, and continuous improvement), and the mechanics of Kanban and the Kanban board

## Intro to Scrum

What is scrum? What are the three scrum roles and four scrum rituals? What is a product backlog vs a sprint backlog? What am I supposed to be doing at sprint planning? or retro? or standup?

This is a pure Scrum "by the book" overview, which probably doesn't look like what we do today, but I think it's valuable to give everyone insight into the textbook process so that we can make informed decisions about how we work and understand why those processes are valuable. This presentation is based on a creative commons deck written by Scrum Alliance co-founder Mike Cohn. See the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/atroutt/intro-to-scrum-fork-from-mountain-goat).

## Tech Talk Brainstorming

Speaking professionally is a great way to deepen your understanding of a topic, show off what you've learned, make new friends in the industry, and even unlock new opportunities. Whether it's for a meetup, a conference, or even here internally at work, devs often say "but don't have anything to talk about." I assure you that isn't true. In this workshop we will go through several exercises to get your tech talk ideas flowing and share them around with the group. By the end you should have several ideas!.

## Programming with Scratch on the Raspberry Pi

I co-wrote and co-taught this workshop for girls age 11-14 for [TechGirlz](http://www.techgirlz.org/). This course is for students with any range of experience with programming and using hardware. We explain the basics of electronic circuits. Students learn to build circuits, program blinking lights, and use buttons. The lesson uses the programming language Scratch to program the hardware (buttons, lights). The students learn about programming concepts such as if statements and loops. This course was published to TechGirlz's TechShop library and has since been updated and re-taught numerous times. See the [original course repo](https://github.com/atroutt/scratch-pi).

## Client Side Programming

As an Adjunct Professor, I taught "Client Side Programming", an introductory Java programming course for undergraduates. Students learned how to create object-oriented GUI applications in Java.
