## Testing
As this is a simple static website, testing is primarily manual:
1. **Visual Inspection:**
    - Open `index.html` in different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent rendering.
    - Check that all content, including text and images, displays correctly.
    - Verify that the layout is responsive by resizing the browser window or using browser developer tools to simulate different device viewports.
2. **Functionality Check:**
    - Click on all navigation tabs (About, Speaking, Writing, Teaching) to ensure they switch content correctly.
    - Test all external links to make sure they lead to the correct destinations.
    - Verify that any interactive elements, like the scroll reveal effect, are working as expected.
3. **(Optional) Linting:**
    - You can use linters to check the quality of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
    - For HTML, consider using a tool like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
    - For CSS, tools like [CSSLint](http://csslint.net/) or the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) can be helpful.
    - For JavaScript, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) are popular choices.
