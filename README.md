# Source code for audreytroutt.com

Personal website of Audrey Troutt, an accomplished hands-on technology leader. This site showcases her experience, speaking engagements, writings, and teaching activities.

## Running the App
Look, this is my personal portfolio site. Why would *you* want to run it? Are you me? If so, hi Audrey! Here's the most basic ai-generated instructions for how to run and load it in case you (I?) forgot:

1. Run the command:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

If you're NOT Audrey, seriously, there are probably more interesting things to do. Like watching paint dry. Or learning interpretive dance.

## Testing
Again, this is *my* site. So, unless you're me (Audrey), why are you testing this? Did you find a bug? Are you trying to help? That's... unexpectedly nice of you. Anyway, if I (Audrey) need to test my own site, here's what I'd do:

As this is a simple static website, testing is primarily manual:
1. **Visual Inspection:**
    - Open `index.html` in different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent rendering.
    - Check that all content, including text and images, displays correctly.
    - Verify that the layout is responsive by resizing the browser window or using browser developer tools to simulate different device viewports.
2. **Functionality Check:**
    - Click on all navigation tabs (About, Speaking, Writing, Teaching) to ensure they switch content correctly.
    - Test all external links to make sure they lead to the correct destinations.
3. **(Optional) Linting:**
    - You can use linters to check the quality of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
    - For HTML, consider using a tool like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
    - For CSS, tools like [CSSLint](http://csslint.net/) or the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) can be helpful.
    - For JavaScript, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) are popular choices.

If you're not me and you actually did all this, let me know if something's broken!
